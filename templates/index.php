<h3>Hi there!</h3>
<p>
    Welcome to <b>I &lt;heart> 2FA</b>, an example site showing some examples of
    two-factor authentication in action. This site was created as a part of a demonstration for
    the <a href="http://confoo.ca">Confoo 2041</a> talk "<a href="http://confoo.ca/en/2014/session/2fa-the-rise-of-two-factor-auth">2FA: The Rise of Two-Factor Auth</a>" 
    presented by <i>Chris Cornutt</i>.
</p>
<p>
	There are examples of two types of two-factor authentication on this site:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="/gauth">Google Authenticator</a></li>
	<li><a href="/sms">Manual SMS sending</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	You can find out more about two-factor authentication and tutorials showing you several 
	different types (along with sample code) in the <a href="http://websec.io/tagged/twofactor">Two-Factor Auth</a>
